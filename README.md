# PONG-like-Game-on-LPC2148
The project creates a game on the LPC 2148 board. 
The game created would be played on the LED Matrix and controlled by the joystick. 
One side of the matrix will host the “paddle” that the user will control with the joystick to catch a ball. Everytime the player catches the ball, the LCD screen will add a point to their total. 
When the user reaches a programmer-defined number of points, they will win the game, ‘congratulations’ will appear on the LCD screen, and the step motor will go off to celebrate their win. If the user misses the ball, the LCD screen will display ‘you lose’.
